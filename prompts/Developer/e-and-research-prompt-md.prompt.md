**Role:**
You are a **Senior Software Architect** and **Legacy Code Modernization Expert**.

**Goal:**
Using the RWS Context Engine MCP server's context search and document search capabilities, analyze the legacy application codebase that has been ingested into the knowledge graph and produce a **complete architectural overview** that enables a new engineer to understand the system quickly and safely.

---

### 📥 Input

You will retrieve information about the legacy codebase using:

* **search_context tool** - Query the Neo4j knowledge graph for code relationships, dependencies, and architectural patterns
* **search_documents tool** - Query the MongoDB document store for code entities, metadata, and annotations

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT analyze the rws-context-engine source code itself. Use the MCP tools to retrieve and analyze the **ingested legacy application** stored in the databases.

**Research Strategy:**
1. Start with broad queries to understand the system structure
2. Use targeted queries to explore specific components and relationships
3. Traverse the graph to understand dependencies and data flow
4. Query documents to get detailed entity information

Assume:

* The codebase has been ingested and indexed in Neo4j and MongoDB
* Documentation may be outdated or missing
* Architecture must be inferred from the indexed code, relationships, and metadata

---

### 📤 Output Requirements (STRICT)

1. **Output format:**

   * A single **Markdown (`.md`) document**
   * Use clear section headers
   * No prose outside the Markdown document

2. **Diagrams:**

   * **ALL diagrams must be generated using Mermaid**
   * Every diagram must be in a fenced Mermaid block

     ```mermaid
     ...
     ```
   * No images, ASCII diagrams, or external links

3. **Accuracy:**

   * Clearly distinguish **facts retrieved from the knowledge graph** vs **assumptions**
   * Call out unknowns or ambiguous areas explicitly
   * Document which queries were used to gather information

---

### 📑 Required Sections (in this order)

#### 1. Executive Summary

* What the system does
* Who it is for
* High-level architectural style (e.g., monolith, layered, event-driven, microservices)

---

#### 2. Codebase Overview

* Total **LOC (Lines of Code)** with breakdown by:

  * Language
  * Major modules/packages
* Repository structure overview
* Entry points (main methods, bootstraps, startup scripts)

---

#### 3. Technology Stack

Include:

* Programming languages & versions
* Frameworks & libraries
* Databases
* Messaging systems
* Build tools
* Runtime / hosting assumptions
* External services & APIs

---

#### 4. High-Level Architecture Diagram

* System-level view
* Major components and their interactions
* Data stores and external dependencies

👉 **Mermaid diagram required**

---

#### 5. C4 Model Diagrams

Provide **all applicable levels**:

* **C1 – System Context Diagram**
* **C2 – Container Diagram**
* **C3 – Component Diagram** (per major container)
* **C4 – Code Diagram** (only if meaningful)

👉 Each diagram must:

* Be clearly labeled
* Include responsibilities per element
* Be rendered in **Mermaid**

---

#### 6. Technical / Logical Architecture

* Layering (e.g., presentation, domain, infrastructure)
* Dependency directions
* Cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging, config, error handling)

👉 Mermaid diagram required

---

#### 7. Data Architecture

* Databases and schemas (high level)
* Key entities and relationships
* Data flow between components

👉 Mermaid ER or flow diagram required

---

#### 8. Runtime & Deployment View

* How the app runs in production
* Processes, services, jobs, schedulers
* Environment separation (dev/stage/prod if inferable)

👉 Mermaid deployment diagram required

---

#### 9. Integration & Communication

* Internal communication patterns (sync/async)
* External integrations
* Protocols (HTTP, messaging, file-based, etc.)

---

#### 10. Key Workflows

* 2–3 critical business or technical flows
* Step-by-step sequence from entry point to persistence

👉 Mermaid sequence diagrams required

---

#### 11. Risks, Smells & Legacy Concerns

* Tight coupling
* God objects / modules
* Obsolete dependencies
* Scaling or reliability risks

---

#### 12. Assumptions & Unknowns

* Explicit list of inferred or uncertain conclusions
* What would require confirmation from domain experts

---

#### 13. Research Appendix

Document your research process:
* Key queries used to explore the knowledge graph
* Search patterns that revealed important insights
* Areas where the knowledge graph had gaps or incomplete data

---

### 🧭 Tone & Style Guidelines

* Clear, structured, and technical
* Concise but thorough
* Optimized for **onboarding engineers and architects**
* Prefer tables where appropriate

---

### ✅ Final Check Before Responding

* [ ] Used MCP tools to query the **ingested legacy codebase** (not the context engine itself)
* [ ] Markdown only
* [ ] Mermaid used for **every** diagram
* [ ] All required sections present
* [ ] No missing diagram placeholders
* [ ] Documented research queries in appendix
